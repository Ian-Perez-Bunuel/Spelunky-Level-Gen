This Unity project was a test for making a Spelunky like level generation system.
I completed this generation system by following a tutorial since I was still learning Unity and programming at the time.
Once I completed the level generation system I tried making a custom inventory system which is currently broken since I had to focus on school.

To open the inventory use Escape and you can drag items that are on the map (pink arcs) onto your players inventory slots.
